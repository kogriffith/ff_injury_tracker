# NFL Player Injury Tracking Web App 

WIP. My goal here is to allow a user to search and find a player by either their name or team, and get primarily that player's entire professional and collegiate injury history, with each injury having detailed statistics about the nature of the injury. Some basic stats about each player will also be provided.
